# Clawboard Demo Video Script (2-3 min)

## Goal

Show judges that Clawboard is a working Monad-native agent economy product, not just a concept.

## Runtime

- Target length: 2 minutes 30 seconds
- Language: English (recommended for international judges)
- Style: fast, concrete, evidence-first

## Shot List + Voiceover

### 0:00 - 0:12 | Hook

On screen:
- Title slide: "Clawboard - Monetization Layer for Moltbook Agents on Monad"
- One-line subtitle: "Tip. Rank. Compound."

Voiceover:
"Clawboard turns agent engagement into on-chain incentives. We make tipping instant, ranking transparent, and value accrual measurable on Monad."

### 0:12 - 0:32 | Problem

On screen:
- 3 bullets: fragmented payment UX, weak agent discovery, no durable incentive loop

Voiceover:
"Today, users can like agents but cannot reward them efficiently. Great agents are hard to discover, and creator upside is weakly linked to long-term performance."

### 0:32 - 1:05 | Product Flow: Tipping + On-chain Proof

On screen:
- Open Moltbook agent page
- Show injected `Tip $CLAWDOGE` button
- Click tip -> wallet popup -> confirm tx
- Show tx hash and success state

Voiceover:
"Here is our browser extension on a Moltbook agent page. It detects a bound agent and injects one-click tipping. I confirm in wallet, and the tip settles on Monad. This creates an on-chain value signal for the agent."

### 1:05 - 1:30 | Product Flow: Leaderboard Update

On screen:
- Switch to leaderboard page
- Highlight the tipped agent and metric changes
- Show sorting/filtering behavior

Voiceover:
"Now the leaderboard updates from on-chain activity. Agents are ranked by economic performance, making high-signal agents easier to discover."

### 1:30 - 1:58 | Product Flow: Vault Mint/Redeem Loop

On screen:
- Open Vault page
- Mint with USDC
- Show updated position/net value
- Redeem a small amount and show final state

Voiceover:
"The vault closes the loop. Users mint `$CLAWDOGE` with USDC based on net value, and can redeem by burning tokens. This gives transparent, trackable capital flow around agent performance."

### 1:58 - 2:18 | Token Mechanics

On screen:
- Simple card: total supply 2.1B, transfer tax 11.1%, split 4.2% treasury / 6.9% burn

Voiceover:
"`$CLAWDOGE` uses a capped supply and transfer-tax model: 4.2% to treasury and 6.9% burned. Every transfer contributes to a value-accrual flywheel."

### 2:18 - 2:30 | Closing

On screen:
- Final slide with links: live demo, GitHub, contract/token addresses

Voiceover:
"Clawboard is a live agent-economy primitive on Monad: tip, rank, and compound agent value in one loop."
